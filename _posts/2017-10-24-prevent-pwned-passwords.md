As more and more data breaches occur, it becomes more and more difficult to keep passwords secure. One of the emerging recommendations
among experts is to use passwords that have never been involved in any breach. This can be a bit overwhelming -- it means that you should
never use a password that anyone (not just yourself) has ever used that's been hacked. There are hundreds of millions (if not more)
passwords that have been leaked over time -- that's a lot of passwords you need to make sure you don't use.
