<p>I'm a software architect and developer. A few of the projects I've been involved with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.wallit.io">wallit.io</a>: a paywall startup</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.magnetag.com">MagneTag</a>: imagine if LaserTag were a hundred times cooler</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.missingpadlock.com">Missing Padlock</a>: make sure browsers show that secure padlock on your site</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ChrisP1118">My GitHub Projects</a>: not a lot here, but it's a start</li>
</ul>
